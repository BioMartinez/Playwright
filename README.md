# Playwright

- This Test Automation project is based on `Playwright` and `TypeScript`.  
- The tested page is a simple demo of a bank.  
- It was written during a training organized by [jaktestowac.pl](https://jaktestowac.pl/playwright/) and is still being developed.

## Currently repository:
- contains 7 test cases within 3 sets
- is refactored according to the AAA (Arrange Act Assert) pattern
- contains hooks (beforeEach) construction
- contains POM (Page Object Model)

## It is planned:
- increasing the number of test cases - outside of the training

Any suggestions that could improve my PW learning are welcome.
