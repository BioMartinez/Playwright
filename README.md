# Playwright

This Test Automation project is based on `Playwright` and `TypeScript`.  
The tested page is a simple demo of a bank.  
It was written during a training organized by jaktestowac.pl and is still being developed.

## How to run?
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
$ npx playwright test
```

## Currently repository:
- contains 7 test cases within 3 sets
- is refactored according to the AAA (Arrange Act Assert) pattern
- contains hooks (beforeEach) construction

## It is planned:
- use of POM (Page Object Model) - within the training
- increasing the number of test cases - outside of the training

Any suggestions that could improve my PW learning are welcome.
